## Purpose

This is a personal presentation site. Any fixes or requests are welcome to be filed as issues.

### Installation

Warning: outdated! dev-stage processing and minification is now broken (because outdated gulp had to be removed) and is done manually with vscode plugins or omitted.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm i` in its root folder _eg. C:\\jandu\\_

If not: check if you have updated **npm** and then check the browser's **console** for errors. Upstream issues have some hints too.

### Usage

You could use this as your own portfolio site too, it's easy! Just change some colors, text and images. It would be nice from you to **not** target the same area or field, as this repo does (ie. UX in Central Europe).

### Dev setup

_TL;DR: `git clone https://github.com/demoklion/jandu.git && cd jandu/ && npm i`_.

This runs on GitHub Pages. It was forked from a free template based on Bootstrap 4 and modified using VS Code. It will forever be a WIP with irregular upgrades & changes. To setup the dev environment, you just need to download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), then follow instructions in Installation section.
