# Claude Code Portfolio Enhancement Plan - jandu.top

## Project Objective

Transform jandu.top from €80-120/hour "Product Designer" positioning to €200-400/hour "Enterprise AI Transformation Consultant" positioning.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Strengths to Preserve

- Clean, professional design aesthetic
- Clear case study structure (Target → Role → Artifacts)
- Personal accessibility and approachability
- Multi-language capability (Czech/English)
- Strong institutional credibility signals

### Critical Gaps to Address

- No AI/agentic capabilities mentioned anywhere, because none used were yet brought to market
- Generic "Product Designer" title (commoditized)
- No financial services experience highlighted except Golem
- Missing business impact metrics/ROI, because there weren't consistently measured, but can be guessed or adapted from eg. app store ratings and corporation valuations
- No premium pricing signals or value indicators
- Underplayed teaching/thought leadership credentials

## Phase 1: Content Strategy & Information Architecture

```

### 2.2 NGO Case Study Evolution

**Enhanced**:

(save this for later, i did it before ai boom)

### 2.3 New Case Study: AI Implementation

```
Title: "Industry AI Transformation: From Concept to (TODO €) Savings"

```

## Phase 3: New Content Sections

### 3.1 "AI & Agentic Expertise" Section

```
Content Strategy:
- Visual demonstration of Claude Code workflows (suggest)
- Before/after efficiency comparisons
- ROI calculator for AI implementation (you code this)
- Technology stack and capabilities
- Client success stories specific to AI (none yet)

Key Messages:
- "Running out of Claude Code tokens" → "Advanced practitioner"
- Complex agentic workflows → "Cutting-edge capability"

```

```
Content Elements:

- Banking regulation expertise
- Fintech innovation examples
- Risk management through design

Credibility Signals:
- €2M+ project values
- Regulatory compliance rates
- Cost savings achieved
- Team sizes managed
- Timeline compression examples
- Education and workshops done in large product orgs
```

### 3.3 "Teaching & Thought Leadership" Section

```
Content Strategy:

```

## Phase 4: Premium Positioning Elements

Remote-first advantage positioning transforms perceived weakness into strength. Successful consultants emphasize "follow the sun" capabilities, cultural alignment with Western practices, and cost efficiency enabling competitive total project costs rather than cheap hourly rates.

```
Showcase Aggregate Results:
- €5M+ in total project value
- 60% average efficiency improvement
- 40+ teams trained and scaled
- (suggest more)
```

### 4.2 Service Packages & Pricing Signals

```
Strategic Consulting Packages:
1. "AI Readiness Assessment" (€15k-25k)
2. "Agentic Workflow Implementation" (€25k-50k)
3. "Enterprise Design Systems Transformation" (€50k-150k)
4. "Executive AI Education Program" (€10k-30k)

Positioning Language:
- "Investment" instead of "cost"
- "Partnership" instead of "project"
- "Transformation" instead of "design"
- "ROI" instead of "deliverables"
```

### 4.3 Client Testimonials & Social Proof

```
Target Testimonial Themes:
- "Transformed our approach to AI"
- "Delivered €X in measurable savings"
- "Only consultant who understood both fintech and AI"

Social Proof Elements:
- University affiliation logos

```

## Phase 5: Technical Implementation Plan

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Concerns

- **Over-positioning**: Risk of claiming capabilities beyond current experience
- **Market Reception**: Czech market may not support premium positioning immediately
- **Competition Response**: Existing players may react to new positioning
- **claude over-eagerness to please**: makes it hallucinate nonexisting data and copy
- **technology is new**: claude code has like a few days and new tech comes up daily
- **inexperience in solo high profile consulting**: people usually have whole agencies around them, we are reaching into areas where big consulting firms rule and they may react

### Mitigation Strategies

- Ground all claims in verifiable experience and results
- Gradual rate increases with value justification
- Focus on unique combination (banking + AI + institutional + public) that's hard to replicate
- Build strong referral network before competitors can respond

## Next Steps After Portfolio Update

1. **LinkedIn Profile Alignment** (coordinate with portfolio changes)
2. **Content Marketing Launch** (no original content, loses value in AI-centric times, more like share best practice from elsewhere and keep finding niches)
3. **Network Activation** (reach out to former colleagues, clients)
4. **Service Package Testing** (pilot programs with existing relationships)
5. **Thought Leadership Development** (establish expertise in AI + banking)

## important

no bullshitting. we source everything we say. if we guess a number, we say so, and give industry source about that number and how they get to it. if we only plan to do something or something is WIP, we say so. ask often.
