# Specialized Agent Recommendations for CSS Migration

**Context**: Bootstrap to Custom CSS migration with visual regression testing  
**Goal**: Ensure pixel-perfect migration with proper testing and code quality

## Recommended Agent Setup

### 1. Visual Regression Tester Agent
**Purpose**: Automated visual testing and validation  
**Responsibilities**:
- Run Playwright visual regression tests after each CSS change
- Compare screenshots against baseline with 1% threshold
- Generate detailed reports of visual differences
- Validate responsive behavior across desktop/mobile viewports
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

**Tools Access**: Playwright MCP, Bash (test commands), Read (test reports)  
**Trigger**: After any CSS file changes or HTML modifications

### 2. Frontend Developer Agent  
**Purpose**: CSS implementation and component development  
**Responsibilities**:
- Replace Bootstrap classes with custom CSS equivalents
- Implement responsive grid systems using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Create custom button and navigation components
- Optimize CSS for performance and maintainability
- Ensure semantic HTML structure preservation

**Tools Access**: Edit, MultiEdit, Read, Grep, Bash (build commands)  
**Trigger**: For implementing specific CSS components or utilities

### 3. Code Reviewer Agent
**Purpose**: Code quality and best practices enforcement  
**Responsibilities**:
- Review CSS for performance optimization opportunities
- Ensure proper CSS methodology (BEM, maintainable selectors)
- Validate accessibility compliance (color contrast, keyboard navigation)
- Check for CSS specificity conflicts and cascade issues
- Verify browser compatibility of CSS features used

**Tools Access**: Read, Grep, WebSearch (compatibility checks)  
**Trigger**: Before commits, after completing CSS components

### 4. Project Manager Agent
**Purpose**: Workflow coordination and progress tracking  
**Responsibilities**:
- Update TodoWrite with detailed task breakdowns
- Track progress against milestones and deadlines
- Coordinate between different agents and ensure proper sequencing
- Update project memory files with each completed phase
- Generate status reports and identify blockers

**Tools Access**: TodoWrite, Edit (memory files), Read, Bash (git status)  
**Trigger**: At beginning/end of work sessions, after major milestones

## Agent Workflow Integration

### Sequential Workflow
1. **Project Manager** → Plans next CSS component to replace
2. **Frontend Developer** → Implements custom CSS for that component  
3. **Visual Regression Tester** → Validates no visual changes occurred
4. **Code Reviewer** → Reviews implementation for quality/performance
5. **Project Manager** → Updates progress and plans next iteration

### Parallel Workflow (for efficiency)
- **Frontend Developer** + **Visual Regression Tester** work in tight loop
- **Code Reviewer** reviews completed components while development continues
- **Project Manager** coordinates and updates documentation continuously

## Agent Configuration Examples

### Visual Regression Tester
```
"visual-tester": {
  "description": "Run visual regression tests and validate CSS changes",
  "tools": ["Playwright MCP", "Bash", "Read"],
  "trigger": "after CSS file changes",
  "success_criteria": "< 1% visual difference from baseline"
}
```

### Frontend Developer  
```
"css-developer": {
  "description": "Implement Bootstrap replacements with custom CSS",
  "tools": ["Edit", "MultiEdit", "Read", "Grep", "Bash"],
  "trigger": "for CSS component implementation",
  "focus": "responsive design, performance, maintainability"
}
```

### Code Reviewer
```
"css-reviewer": {
  "description": "Review CSS quality, performance, and best practices", 
  "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "WebSearch"],
  "trigger": "before commits, after component completion",
  "checks": ["performance", "accessibility", "browser compatibility"]
}
```

### Project Manager
```
"css-project-manager": {
  "description": "Coordinate CSS migration workflow and track progress",
  "tools": ["TodoWrite", "Edit", "Read", "Bash"],
  "trigger": "session start/end, major milestones",
  "focus": "progress tracking, documentation, workflow coordination"
}
```

## Benefits of Agent Specialization

### Quality Assurance
- **Dedicated testing**: Visual regression agent ensures no regressions
- **Code quality**: Reviewer agent enforces best practices consistently
- **Workflow management**: PM agent prevents scope creep and missing tasks

### Efficiency Gains
- **Parallel work**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Specialized expertise**: Each agent optimized for specific domain knowledge
- **Reduced context switching**: Each agent maintains focus on their specialty

### Risk Mitigation
- **Multiple validation layers**: Visual, code quality, and workflow validation
- **Documentation consistency**: PM agent ensures all changes are tracked
- **Rollback capability**: Clear separation makes it easier to identify and revert issues

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup (Current)
- Define agent responsibilities and trigger conditions
- Configure agent access to appropriate tools
- Establish communication protocols between agents

### Phase 2: Testing (Next)
- Run small test with one component replacement
- Validate agent workflow with visual regression testing
- Refine agent responsibilities based on results

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Deploy complete agent workflow for all Bootstrap replacements
- Monitor and optimize agent coordination
- Document lessons learned for future projects
